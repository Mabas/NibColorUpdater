# What's this?

This is an editor to update resources in `.xib` and `.storyboard` files

## Why?

Creating named color Assets to keep the color pallete synced in our app is nice, but sometimes we have to change some colors due to a rebranding, there is an issue in this files that if you change the color in the Assets file they are not getting updated throught nibs

# Usage

### 1. Create a `.xib` file using all the colors that needs update


### 2. Get the url of that file and paste in the main file `xibCatalogPath` parameter


### 3. Paste the url of your project in main file `sourcePath` parameter


### 4. Run


### 5. Check console for results
